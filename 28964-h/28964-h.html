Captain Keene has made an interesting
contribution to the literature of the present war
in his account of service, which covers the experience
of a young officer in the making and on
the battle front,—the transformation of an
artist into a first-class machine-gun officer. He
covers the training period at home and abroad
and the work at the front. This direct and interesting
account should serve to bring home to
all of us an appreciation of how much has to be
done before troops can be made effective for
modern war, the cost of unpreparedness, and
the disadvantage under which troops, partially
equipped, labor when they meet highly organized
ones, prepared, even to the last detail, for
all the exigencies of modern war. It also brings
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
out the splendid spirit of Canada, the Mother
Country, and the distant Colonies,—the spirit
of the Empire, united and determined in a just
cause.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This and similar accounts should serve to
make clear to us the wisdom of the admonition
of Washington and many others: <span class="tei tei-q">“In time of
peace prepare for war.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many young Americans are about to undergo
experiences similar to those of Captain Keene,
and a perusal of this modest and straight-forward
narrative will help in the great work of
getting ready.

The Laurentian Mountains in the
Province of Quebec are noted for
their beauty, fine hunting and fishing,
and are the stamping-grounds for many
artists from the States and Eastern Canada.
It was in this capacity that I was working
during the hot summer of 1914. All through
June and July I sketched with my father.
Other than black flies my only worry was
the price of my tubes of color.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We usually received our newspapers two
or three days after publication; consequently
we were poorly posted on worldly happenings.
Suddenly the war clouds gathered and
almost before we knew it they became so
threatening that we grew restless, and even
went in to the depot to get our papers so
that we could have the news sooner.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The assassination of the Austrian Crown
Prince and the subsequent events were exciting,
but it was only when Russia sent
that one word <span class="tei tei-q">“Mobilize”</span> to Serbia that
we suspected serious results. Even the
summer visitors from the States exhibited
signs of excitement, yet they were skeptical
of the chances of war; that is, war that would
really affect us! My newspaper in Montreal
wired for me to come down to do war cartoons
and I left my father and hiked to the
depot.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Montreal train was crowded and conversation
centered on the one topic, War;
the English Navy's ability to maintain her
rule of the seas, and what would Canada do.
A young Austrian reservist two seats away
was telling some people in a loud voice how
much he wanted to get into it. He was going
back to answer the call. And I had already
begun to hear my country's call.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A newsboy boarding the train at a junction
was overwhelmed and succeeded in getting
twenty-five cents a copy for his papers.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Montreal teemed with suppressed anxiety
and every hour fresh news was posted.
Special bulletin boards were put up on store
fronts. Already men in uniform were seen
in the street. And men were trying to enlist.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The war fever was rising steadily; the
chief occupation of Canadians in those days
was watching the bulletin boards. Rumors
of sea fights, ultimatums, disasters, and
victories were common. The Kaiser seemed
to declare war on the world at the rate of
three countries a day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the night of August 4th, as I was
putting the finishing touches on a cartoon,
a friend burst into the room:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Come out
of here! Something must happen any
minute now.”</span> We marched downtown,—everybody
marched in those days; walking
was abolished in its favor. One met demonstrations
everywhere, large crowds of cheering
men with flags, victrolas at shop windows
played patriotic airs, and soldiers with civilians
crowded before the bulletin boards
singing the national anthems with great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
enthusiasm. The King had declared war
and his message to the fleet had just been
put up! Newspaper extras were given away
by thousands and movies of the British
Navy were shown on the street. Any one
who thought the British could not enthuse,
changed his mind then.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The audiences at the theatres and moving
picture houses on receipt of the news rose
simultaneously and sang the national anthems,
then cheered themselves hoarse.
These were the first days of the war. Several
battalions of militia were called out and
posted to protect the bridges and grain
elevators. Battalions were raised overnight,
and so many recruits came forward
that men were refused by the score. England
was immediately offered ten battalions.
Then an army division was possible.
The Militia Department suddenly became
a hive of industry. Men with all kinds of
business capacity tendered their services
gratis, and the Canadian war machine,

took shape. They worked night and
day bringing everlasting credit on themselves.
Banks offered full pay to their employees in
uniform, and this example was widely followed.
The principle prompting this action
being, <span class="tei tei-q">“It's our country; if we can't fight
ourselves, we will help others to fight for
her.”</span>

Existent camp sites were inadequate, hence
new ones were necessary. We had a few,
but none were big enough. We bought
Valcartier, one of the best sites in the world,
which was equipped almost over-night with
water service, electric light and drainage.
The longest rifle range in the world with
three and one-half miles of butts was constructed.
Railroad sidings were put in and
35,000 troops from all over the Dominion
poured into it. Think of it,—Canada with
her population of seven and one-half millions
offering 35,000 volunteers the first few weeks,
without calling out her militia. And even
to-day the militia are yet to be called.
Thus every Canadian who has served at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the front has been a volunteer. England
accepted an army division. Fifteen hundred
qualified officers were told that they
would have to stay and train men for the
next contingent. But this was not fighting.
They were dissatisfied. They resigned their
commissions and went as privates. Uniforms,
boots, rifles and equipment were
found for everybody. Every man was
trained as much as possible in the time
allowed, and within six weeks of the declaration
of war, guns, horses and 35,000 men
were going forward to avenge Belgium.

With me the question of signing up was
a big one. In the first place, I wanted to
go; I wanted to go quickly. Several other
fellows and myself had decided upon a
certain battalion. But much to our disgust
and regret we were informed that
enlistments had stopped only a short time
before.

Canada's most prominent citizens, and it
was in this unit that I enlisted with my
friend Pat, a six-foot, husky Scotchman,
with the fighting blood of the kilties very
near the surface. We were immediately
transported to Ottawa in company with
fifty other picked men from Montreal. At
Ottawa the complement of our battery was
completed upon the arrival of one hundred
more men from Ottawa and Toronto. Here
we trained until it came time for us to move
to Montreal, and there the battery was embarked
on board the Corinthian with a unit
of heavy artillery. We sailed down to Quebec
where we joined the other ships assembled
to take over the First Canadian Contingent.

Quebec looked very fine. The big guns

Valcartier have had a rough time. They
actually look as if they had come through a

The Corinthian sailed from Quebec to
Father Point, where a patrol boat arrived
with orders. We then sailed into the Gulf,
but toward evening we turned into the coast.
When we passed Fame Point Light a small
boat, which afterwards turned out to be
another patrol boat, sailing without lights,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
flashed further orders to us. The Corinthian
immediately turned round and headed back.
The minute the patrol boat's signal light went
out we were unable to distinguish it from the
sea. The coloring is a good protection; even
a boat, close to, sailing without lights, it is
impossible to pick out. Apparently our
orders were to cruise around until daylight
and then sail for the Bay of Gaspé, and this

Towards noon a smart launch came alongside.
Even at a distance the boys were quick
to recognize our popular minister of militia,
Sam Hughes, and a thundering cheer rang
out. With him were several soldiers who
threw bundles of papers aboard. These were

His launch sailed by the ship, and then on to

five o'clock this afternoon just as the twilight

lines. The convoy is now under way and we
extend as far as can be seen in both directions.
We have two military police patrols
whose chief duty is to see that no matches
are struck on deck. Bill, who smokes more
matches than tobacco, has had to go below so
often to light his pipe, that he has decided to
do without smoking on deck. It is surprising
how far a match struck in the dark will show.
We noticed how matches struck on the other

War news is signaled from ship to ship by

even to the advertisements. In our cabin we
have a <span class="tei tei-q">“Saturday Evening Post”</span> of September

on board one hundred of our brigade; two
hundred and sixteen heavy artillery and one
hundred and forty horses, together with artillery
officers and equipment. The horses take
up the same space which in ordinary times

About eleven this morning a commotion
occurred in the middle line. The cruiser
heading it and the second ship, the Royal
Edward, turned back. Also several other
boats turned in their course. As we have
very little excitement we hoped it might be
a German attack, for we all want to see a
naval battle. I looked at the cruiser through
powerful glasses and saw sailors fixing up

it was simply a case of <span class="tei tei-q">“man overboard.”</span>

in spite of the rolling of the deck. This
morning, while in the middle of it I was called
away to dress and form part of an escort to
the prisoner who was to be tried by field
court-martial to-day. The court was very
dignified, and it took a long time owing to
the inexperience of the officers in such

The poor devil expects two years.

Quite a number of the transports have guns
mounted on board so they are not entirely

I have just heard that five more battleships

been out of sight. We are sailing north of
the trade routes.

The fleet is being increased. All ships are
stopped. Those sailing west are allowed to
go after being boarded; those going in the
same direction as ourselves are made to fall
into line, so there will be no danger of the
news of our sailing reaching Europe ahead

twelve miles the last twenty-four hours.

Two more transports have joined us.
They came from Newfoundland. I hear

about one thousand yards.

We are getting into more dangerous water
evidently. Early this morning the Royal
George steamed up from the end of the line
and took up a position at the head of the
fleet, but in line with the battleship Glory
about three miles away on the port. The
Laurentic took up a similar position on the
starboard. Both these ships are armored

are being used as scouts.

We all rushed up on deck to see a cruiser
pass close to us this midday. It was a magnificent

The bluejackets were massed on the

band played <span class="tei tei-q">“The Maple Leaf Forever.”</span>
We returned cheers with the sailors. It
gives you a great thrill to see a British ship
and to have the knowledge of what it represents.
To be British is a great thing, and
I'm proud to think that I'm going to fight
for my country. When this war is over and

The finding of the court-martial was read
out to us on full parade this afternoon.
First the <span class="tei tei-q">“Heavies”</span> were lined up on all

inside; the prisoner between an escort was
led up in the center. It was wonderfully
impressive. I felt that I was to witness the
condemning of a fellow soldier to a number
of years of hard labor. Over the whole
assembly there came a deathlike silence and
the finding of the court was read to us by an
officer, the sentence being thirty-six days!

The second steward told me that it took
two hundred carpenters twelve hours to tear

Early this morning a large man-o'-war

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was on guard last night when one of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cruisers came alongside to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">talk</span></span> to the
captain about having lights showing in some
of the ports. I enjoyed it immensely, for I
discovered that the British Navy, true to
tradition, was still able to maintain its high
level of profanity. The ship is in pitch
darkness and there is no moon. On deck it's
almost impossible to walk it's so dark.
Tonight is supposed to be the night on
which the Germans are going to make a
raid. I am going to sleep on deck so that
I shall not miss anything. I'd hate to miss
the chance of seeing a naval engagement.
I can't see how the Germans can possibly
let a chance go by. A nervy cruiser could
sink any amount of ships. If the British
Navy were up against us they would have
had a cut in before now.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Slept on deck last night. Nothing happened
except that early this morning a
French cruiser joined us, and I got covered
with smuts from the smokestack.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Admiral has received one hundred
and twenty-six words of war news, but will
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not let us have them. Probably they're
disastrous. We break up to-night or to-morrow.
It's scarcely likely that the whole
fleet will be taken to one port at the same
time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That super-dreadnaught passed down the
columns to-day. She is of tremendous size
and travels at high speed. She is probably
the Queen Mary.

Expect to see land Wednesday.

Blowing a gale. All day the spendrift has
been blowing over. The decks have been
too wet for parades, thank God! All the way
over we have had physical exercise, sometimes
as much as four hours a day. We're
all in fine physical condition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To-day we were allowed to wash our
clothes. I can see the advantage of khaki
now. Even after working hard on my
clothes, my underwear is still dark white.
The rails were covered with underwear
and socks when the storm started. Now
every square inch below is used for drying
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
clothes. Even the electric lights are festooned.
We have a final kit inspection
to-morrow and then we pack for disembarkation.
We are only about one hundred
miles from the <span class="tei tei-q">“Bishop's Light.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been a very long voyage and we
have been very cramped. All our equipment
has to be carried in our cabins. Try sleeping
six men with all their outfit in a cabin nine
feet by six feet. The ship carpenter has a
standing job to repair our cabin. We have
rough-housed so much that his attention
was continually necessary. The trip has
been so long that we are now beginning to
hate each other. I went down in the stoke-hole
and the engine-room. Even amongst
the whirling machines it was more peaceful
than in our quarters. It seems months since
I was in Montreal last.

We're lying in the historic harbor of
Plymouth; arrived here about two hours
ago. We're surrounded by fast little torpedo-boat
destroyers, which are chasing round us
all the time like dogs loosened from a chain.
The breakwater has searchlights mounted
on each end and fixed lights are playing
from the shore. As the lights occasionally
flash up the ships in the bay, it is as bright
as day. Nobody is allowed ashore, not even
the officers. We may go on to Southampton,
only we must get there before five at night.
After that time nothing is allowed in.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sailed at daybreak on to Devonport.
Most of the transports are now lying in pairs
at anchor in the harbor. We're close to the
shore. We can see naval <span class="tei tei-q">“jolly boats”</span> and
pinnaces sailing back and forth. On one
side are lying the H.M.S Powerful and
another boat, both of which in their day
were the pride of the Navy. The Powerful
was the boat which made such a name for
herself in the Boer War. Now both of these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
vessels are training ships and obsolete so far
as this war goes.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All our haversacks have been boiled in
coffee to stain them khaki.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the Navy steam launches came by
and we asked them to get us newspapers.
They came back with a bundle and we nearly
had a riot trying to get at them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was only to-day that we heard of the
fall of Antwerp, the atrocities of Belgium,
and the treachery of Maritz in Cape Colony.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We shall be getting off in a few hours and
this may be the last I shall write for some
time. I have put in a great deal of time
during the voyage writing and have done so
under difficulties. Sometimes the cabin has
been torn in pieces, and often arguments,
carried on by leather-lunged opponents of
<span class="tei tei-q">“Kultur,”</span> have made this work hard.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We hear that some paper published an
account of the sinking of twenty of the ships.
This rumor is false, and it's a beastly thing
for the newspaper to do, but you must remember
to discount all news a great deal.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Still on board and we shall probably be
here for a few days more. My, it's galling
to be so near to the land and yet to be cooped
up in our crowded quarters. Crowded
launches and steamers are sailing round the
liners. All day long cheering crowds come
out to see us. Last night another liner
called Florizel, with the First Regiment
Newfoundland troops, tied up to us. They
were a fine-looking lot of men. We told them
we had no tobacco; they threw dozens of tins
of their tobacco and cigarettes over to us.
We fought for them. I got the remains of
one tin with most of the contents spilt.
Still, as many of us haven't had a smoke for
three days, we appreciated it. Several cruisers
have come in to-day, and there seem
to be dozens of submarines and torpedo
boats cruising around all day. The reason
we did not go to Southampton is that five
German submarines were waiting for us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The transports are unloading at the rate of
five or six ships a day. It will probably be our
turn on Sunday. The fleet looks splendid at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
night now that we have most of the lights
on. All night the steel riveters are at work on
three battleships that are being built close by.
Near us are several <span class="tei tei-q">“wooden walls.”</span> One
is a ship of Nelson's, the Queen Adelaide.
Every boat, tug, lighter and motor boat
here is the property of the Admiralty.

<div class="tei tei-tb"><hr style="width: 50%" /></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are probably going to Salisbury Plain
for two months. We are the first Expeditionary
Force to land in England from the dominions
or colonies, but others are on their
way. The sailors from the training ships
serenade us in boats with bands and play
<span class="tei tei-q">“O Canada,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The Maple Leaf Forever,”</span>
and all day long on one ship or the other
we hear <span class="tei tei-q">“It's a Long Way to Tipperary.”</span>
Every one is singing it; without doubt it is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></em> song of the war. To-day we got a bundle
of papers. We read them right through to
the advertisements. Cigarettes and matches
are at a premium and food is running out on
board. The strain of staying here is becoming
too great. We're all disagreeable and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
insubordinate. The guard room is already
full and will soon need enlarging.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On guard to prevent the men of the two
ships (our own and the Florizel with the
Newfoundlanders) coming over to visit each
other. At ten o'clock at night I got the tip
that a bunch of men were going to make a
break for shore and I was asked to go. I
had just come off sentry and was dressed
for shore. We all met up forward, hailed a
police boat, climbed down a rope ladder
across two barges unloading shells and into
the police launch. When I got in I found
that I and one other fellow were the only
privates; all the rest were sergeants and
corporals, thirteen altogether, unlucky number.
The police sergeants asked me if we
had passes. I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“You bet,”</span> and we sailed
away from the ship right under everybody's
nose. We landed and then took a car to
Plymouth and went on the Hoe, which has
been in absolute darkness since the beginning
of the war. Girls were very interested in us
and took most of our collar badges and buttons
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as souvenirs. One man asked me to
give him a cigarette as a souvenir.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We met an English captain in a tobacconist's
and he invited us up to the barracks.
Two of us went. I was one. To get there
we had to go on a street car. We had just
sat down when up the stairs came my
Lieutenant McCarthy. When he saw me he
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“How the hell did you get here?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh,
just swam across.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, if you get caught
it'll be the guard room for you.”</span> I said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Never mind, we'll have company.”</span> He
is a pretty good sport. We went to the
barracks, had a session with the captain, then
went to the quay, picked up the rest of the
men, and sneaked on board. I got to bed
at three and had to get up this morning at
six o'clock to go on guard.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"><hr style="width: 50%" /></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sunday, very tired. On guard all day,
two hours on, four off. It's very unfortunate
having a Sunday guard, because in the ordinary
way we have to attend church parade
in the morning and after having listened
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to a sermon and sung <span class="tei tei-q">“Onward, Christian
Soldiers,”</span> or, <span class="tei tei-q">“Fight the good fight,”</span> we are
free for the day, whereas guards stay on
twenty-four hours.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The major noticed one of the sergeants
coming on board this morning at six o'clock.
The idiot missed us this morning and of
course that dished us. The sergeants got in
wrong. As I am only a private, and therefore
ignorant and simple according to the
military code, and, being with non-commissioned
officers who are supposed to possess
superior intelligence, I got away with it.
The sergeants have had to do sentry on the
same ladder we went down.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Everybody is as disagreeable as possible.
We are lying in midstream and can see the
town. Can you imagine anything more
galling than that?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While I was on guard the Vicar of Plymouth
came aboard and held service. He said
that the last time a Vicar of Plymouth
preached to warriors was just before Drake
sailed to meet the Armada.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thank God! moving at last. We've
moored up to the docks just opposite two
magnificent dreadnaughts. Naval men are
handling our cargo, our kit bags are packed
and we are ready to disembark.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Near our ship's stern is a barge full of
ventilators and spare parts of ships which are
taken away when ships are cleared for action.
Some of the rifle racks were marked Cornwall
and I noticed a davit post with the name
Highflyer, the boat that sank the Kaiser
Wilhelm after she had been preying on the
shipping off South Africa. When a ship is
cleared for action, all inflammable fittings,
such as wooden doors, ladders, racks, extra
boats, and davits, etc., are discarded. If the
order to <span class="tei tei-q">“clear the decks for action”</span> comes
at sea, overboard go all these luxuries. It is
calculated that the cost of <span class="tei tei-q">“clearing decks”</span>
on a cruiser is five thousand dollars.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some of our stuff was unloaded yesterday,
and when the ship moved a guard was placed
over it. When the corporal went down the
gangplank with the relief, Pat and I walked
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
down behind as if we were part of the same,
right by the officers. We had a devil of
a job to get through the dock gates, a
suspicious policeman and sentry on guard.
We told the sergeant of the police a pitiful
story, saying that we hadn't had anything to
eat for three days, and finally he relented.
<span class="tei tei-q">“All right, my lads, only don't <span class="tei tei-q">‘swing the
lead’</span> in town.”</span> We got into Devonport and
went to the biggest hotel. Before they had
time to throw us out we ordered breakfast
of real food. It was fine after the ship's
grub. After sitting there ten minutes, the
general commanding the district came in and
sat behind us. He stared. Two privates
in the same room as the general!! But all
he said was, <span class="tei tei-q">“If you boys can fight as you
eat, you'll make an impression.”</span> Then we
visited some other places!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We went back to the docks and went over
the super-dreadnaughts, Tiger and Benbow,
the biggest war vessels in the world. The
Tiger's speed on her trials was 37.5 knots an
hour.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After we had seen enough, we went back
to the ship and tried to look as if we had been
working with one of the fatigue parties on
shore. It worked!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We marched off the ship midday and then
I had to go on guard again all night. That
was the first time we were allowed ashore to
see the town, and I was on guard, so if I
hadn't slipped ashore on the two occasions
mentioned, I should not have seen it at all.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"><hr style="width: 50%" /></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It rained all night, and when I was off
guard I slept on the top of one of our armored
trucks, under a tarpaulin. It's wonderful
how we can sleep now anywhere, and we
often have our clothes on for three days at a
time. Many a time I sleep with all my
equipment on. Get wet and dry it by keeping
it on. We all have to do it. The idea
of pajamas or baths as necessities seems
funny. At one time I would sooner go without
breakfast than miss a bath. Now I make
sure of the breakfast.

We are going to drive our cars through
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
England to Salisbury Plain. We started this
morning and drove through Devonport.
Cheering crowds everywhere. All our cars
wear the streaming pennants: <span class="tei tei-q">“Canada With
the Empire,”</span> which pleased the people a
great deal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As we rode through the streets people
showered gifts upon us, such as cakes, chocolates,
newspapers and apples, and everywhere
made lusty demonstrations. The
people of Taunton, as soon as they heard that
the Canadians were coming, turned out the
barracks and we were met by all the officers,
who came in to talk to us. One second lieutenant,
after studying me for some time,
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Isn't your name Keene?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> I
replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“but how do you know?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I went
to school with you fifteen years ago.”</span> His
name was Carter; he was in the Second Dorsets.
That night he got me out of barracks
for a couple of hours, and we hashed over
the schoolboy reminiscences. The people of
Taunton were arranging a dance for us, but
nobody was allowed to attend. The major
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
believes in putting us to bed early; his theory
being that a man can't drive cars well after a
party, and he couldn't keep the drivers in
alone.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ladies from Taunton, of the pleasing English
type with beautiful complexions, handed
round all sorts of rubbish, jam puffs, and
other things which belong to the time before
we joined the army.

Salisbury Plain. Arrived to-day. This

Troops are here in thousands and we are
no novelty. The roads are torn up. Mud

cavalry are traveling over the ground. Aeroplanes
are circling overhead and heavy artillery

Owing to our camp having become a swamp

example, I'm a pretty hefty trench digger;
then as a scavenger I am pretty good at

I'm an expert in building things such as

to Northwich, I arrived after a long
journey, lasting sixteen hours, ten minutes
ahead of the letter I'd sent saying I was
coming. My arrival soon spread over the
town. A Canadian—this was a rather
unique thing for Northwich, a little Cheshire
town. Out of a population of about eighteen
thousand, two thousand men have joined the
colors. The men in uniform from the works
are all receiving half pay. The other men
who are staying are working twelve hours a
day and give up part of their pay so that the
jobs of the soldiers will be open when they
come back. Thirty-five Belgian refugees
are being kept here. Money to keep them
for twelve months has been subscribed. One
huge house has been taken over as a hospital
with twenty-three nurses, all volunteers from
Northwich. Everybody has done or is doing
something in the great struggle. The young
ladies in this neighborhood have no use for a
man who is not in khaki, and with customary
north of England frankness tell them so.

already admits one million.

Cerebro-spinal meningitis has broken out,
and in spite of all efforts to check it, seems
to be gaining ground. Several officers have
died with it, and I believe that four battalions
are quarantined. We have to use chloride of
lime on the tent floors and around the lines.
My friend Pat calls it <span class="tei tei-q">“Spike McGuiness.”</span>
The worst of a disease like this is that a
patient never recovers. Even a cure means
partial paralysis for life. I believe that
Salisbury Plain is known for it, and I hear
that all the ground that troops are now
occupying is to be ploughed up when we
leave. As far as that goes we have ploughed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it up a bit already, but a systematic ploughing
will make it more regular. The subsoil
is only four inches, then you come to chalky
clay. The tent-pegs when they are taken
from the ground are covered with chalk.

Several dogs have attached themselves to
us; sometimes they find themselves on a
piece of string, the other end being in a man's
hand. One of these, a big bull terrier, sleeps
in the canteen. The beer is quite safe with
him there, but two nights ago the canteen
tent, after a great struggle, tore itself off the
tent-poles and went fifteen feet up in the air
like a balloon, then collapsed. The dog, I
regret to say, did not stay at his post, so a
quantity of beer will have to be marked down
as lost. This same bull has a pal, a white bull
terrier, who came out with the officers' class
the other morning. We had not been drilling
more than fifteen minutes when he came back
with a large rabbit. We stewed it at night.
It certainly was good.

A quarter guard is three men and a noncom.
The men do two hours on and four off.
When it comes to a man's turn he has to be
on his beat no matter what the weather is
like during the day or night. The cold is
pretty bad and occasionally it snows. Some
units have sentry boxes, but we haven't.
We use a bell tent. I was called this morning
at five o'clock to do my sentry from five to
seven. The small oil stove which serves to
heat the guard tents had evidently been
smoking for an hour, and over everything
was a thick film of lamp-black. Everybody
thought it a great joke until they looked at
themselves in the mirror and caught sight of
their own equipment. We must come off
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
guard as clean as we go on. I got out
quickly and left them swearing and cleaning
up.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From five to seven is the most interesting
relief. I had first to wake the cooks at five
o'clock and then I watched the gradual
waking up of the camp. At six o'clock I
had to wake the orderly sergeants and then
far away in the distance the first bugle
sounded reveille, then it was taken up all
around and gradually the camps all over the
Plains woke up. Men came out of the tents,
the calls for the <span class="tei tei-q">“fall in”</span> sounded, and the
rolls were called and the usual business of
the day commenced. The change from the
deadness of the night with its absolute stillness
all takes place in a very short time. To
a person with any imagination it seems rather
wonderful. You must remember that we
can see for miles, and in every direction there
are hundreds of tents. Each battalion is
separate, and they have great spaces between
them; still wherever you look you can see
tents.

I'm wondering how long the tent will last.
I have been out three times already to look
at the tent pegs. How often it has been so
since we first came on to these plains. If
you are living in tents you notice the changes
in weather more than under ordinary circumstances,
and every rain-storm has meant
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wet feet for us. But now we have been given
new black boots, magnificent things, huge,
heavy <span class="tei tei-q">“ammunition boots,”</span> and the wonderful
thing is they don't let water in. They are
very big and look like punts, but it's dry
feet now. I can tell you I am as pleased with
them as if some one had given me a present
of cold cash. At first they felt something like
the Dutch sabots. They seemed absolutely
unbendable and so we soaked them with
castor-oil. Once they become moulded to
the feet they are fine. Of course they are
not pretty, but they keep the wet out.

great advantage over the old kind—we can

I managed to get a pass to Salisbury on
Saturday and went to the local vaudeville
show. In the row in front of me were several
young officers of the British Army, and it was
striking what a clean-cut lot they were.
England is certainly giving of her best.
They were not very much different from any
others, but at the same time they are the type
of Englishmen who have done things in the
past and will do things again. They are all
Kitchener's Army. Thousands of men who
have never been in the army before threw
up everything to go in the ranks. You see
side by side professors, laborers, lawyers,
doctors, stevedores, carters, all classes, rich
and poor, a great democratic army, drilling
to fight so that this may be a decent world
to live in.

Reviewed by King George V, and it was
indeed a very impressive sight. Although
there were only twenty thousand troops,
they seemed endless. During the time that
the King was on the parade ground in company

about five o'clock just as the reveille was
blowing in the other lines. They were just
leaving for the front, and had made great
fires where they were burning up rubbish
and stuff they couldn't take with them.
Tons of it! Chairs, mattresses, and tables.
When we move, everything except equipment
has to be discarded. We can't do anything
with extras. We have to cut our own stuff
down to the very smallest dimensions. I
walked through the lines afterward of other
battalions who had left, and I saw fold-up
bedsteads, uniforms, equipment, books, buckets,
washing-bowls, cartridges and stoves
of every conceivable kind and shape; hundreds,
from the single <span class="tei tei-q">“Beatrice”</span> to the
big tiled heaters. Some tents were half

Since I last wrote anything in this diary
we have ridden over one hundred and ten

day yesterday it poured. The country was
beautiful, ripening corn everywhere, the

the roads are all national roads built for

on either side are tall, poplar shade trees, so
that the roads run through endless avenues.

At night we stayed in a quaint village inn.
The men all slept in a loft over their machines.
Our soaked clothes were put in the kitchen

To-day we continued our ride; the weather

Normandy villages and suddenly come across
British Tommies—many of them speaking
French. A Royal Navy car has just passed
us; our navy seems omnipresent. I saw an
old woman reading a letter by the side of an
old farmhouse to some old people, evidently
from a soldier, probably their son. It reminded

Great powerful cars rush by here all day

Every hour or so you see a convoy of twenty

ammunition or supplies, or coming back
empty. Every point bristles with sentries
who demand passes. If you are not able to
answer satisfactorily, they just shoot. The
French soldiers have magnificent uniforms;
the predominating color is a sort of cobalt
blue. To see sentries, French and British
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

we don't have time to read all the letters
through. We look for names of places and
numbers of divisions, brigades, etc., but I

Since I last wrote I have been up to the
front line. Everything is different from what
you imagine. The German trenches are
easily distinguished through glasses; their
sand-bags are multi-colored. Shrapnel was
bursting over ruins of an old town in their
lines. When you look through a periscope
at the wilderness, it is difficult to imagine
that thousands of soldiers on both sides have
burrowed themselves into the earth. The
evidence of their alertness is shown by their
snipers, who are always busy whenever the
target is up.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A battery of eight-inch howitzers was
opening fire. Our battery commander, hearing
this, sent us up. The guns, big fellows,
were well concealed. They were painted in
protective colors and covered with screens of
branches to prevent aerial observation. In
the grounds all over the place were dug-outs,
deep rabbit burrows, ten or twelve feet down,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
into which everybody went immediately.
The Germans started their <span class="tei tei-q">“hate.”</span> The
firing is done by hand cord; other big guns
are fired electrically. An enormous flash,
an ear-splitting crash, a great sheet of flame
from the muzzle, and two hundred pounds of
steel is sent tearing through the air to the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Kultur”</span> exponents. The whole gun lifts off
the ground and runs back on its oil-compression
springs. These guns are moved by
their own caterpillar tractors which are kept
somewhere close by. In three quarters of an
hour they can get them started on the road.
The ground for these emplacements was the
orchard of a chateau. While we were there
a whistle blew three times, an order shouted;
immediately the guns were covered up and
the men took cover. The enemy had sent
an aeroplane to locate them. If they could
once find them, hundreds of shells would
rain on this spot in a few minutes. At a few
yards' distance I couldn't see the guns
myself. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Hows”</span> were firing at a house
in the German lines which had been giving
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
trouble. In three rounds they got it and
then started in to <span class="tei tei-q">“dust”</span> the neighborhood.
Of course, the firing is indirect. The officers
and men who are with the guns don't see the
effects. Apparently they fire straight away
in the air. The observation is done by the
forward observing officer in the fire trenches
who corrects them by 'phone.

After the appointed number of rounds had
been fired, we adjourned to the chateau, a
fine house, marble mantelpiece, plaster ceilings,
gilt mirror panels, etc. It has still a
few pieces of furniture left, no carpets, most
of the windows are smashed; shells have
visited it, but chiefly in splinters. I saw one
picture on the wall with a hole drilled in by
a shrapnel bullet which had gone clean
through as though it had been drilled. It
hadn't smashed the glass otherwise. From a
window of the room, which the officers use
as a mess, a neat row of graves is to be seen.
Outside there are great shell holes, most
of them big enough to bury a horse. Suddenly
a shriek and a deafening explosion
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
occurred in the garden. <span class="tei tei-q">“Sixty-pound shrapnel!
Evening hate,”</span> said an artillery sub.
We left! We had been sent up to see the
guns fire and not to be fired at.

To go home we had to pass a village completely
deserted, a village that was once
prosperous, where people lived and traded
and only wanted to be left alone. Now grass
is growing in the streets. Shops have their
merchandise strewn and rotting in all directions.
On one fragment of a wall a family
portrait was still hanging, and a woman's
undergarments. A grand piano, and a perambulator
tied in a knot were trying to
get down through a coal chute. To wander
through a village like this one that has been
smashed up, and with the knowledge that
the smashing up may be continued any time,
is thrilling. Churches are always hateful to
the Germans. They shell them all; bits of
the organs are wrapped around the tombstones,
and coffins, bones and skulls are
churned up into a great stew. In some of the
villages a few of the inhabitants had stayed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and traded with the soldiers. They lived in
cellars usually and suffered terribly. British
military police direct the traffic when there
is any, and are stationed at crossroads with
regular beats like a city policeman.

While traveling to another part of the
line we had an opportunity of seeing the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Archies”</span> (anti-aircraft guns) working.
They were mounted on lorries and fire quite
good-sized shells. They fired about fifty
shots at one Taube, but didn't register a
bull. Later in the evening from a trench we
had the satisfaction of seeing another aeroplane
set on fire, burn, and drop into the
German lines like a shot partridge. Aeroplanes
are as common as birds. Yesterday
a <span class="tei tei-q">“Pfeil”</span> (arrow) biplane came right over
our lines and was chased off by our own
machines. The enemy's aeroplanes have
their iron cross painted on the underside of
their wings and are more hawkish-looking
than ours. They are more often used for
reconnoitering and taking photographs than
for dropping bombs.

him with German. While we were talking,
I noticed some non-coms watching us very

following us back down the road. When he
saw our car he came up and apologized for
having taken us for spies. They are looking
for two Germans in our lines wearing British
uniforms, who have given several gun
positions away. Two days ago the enemy
shelled the road systematically on both sides
for half a mile when an ammunition column
was due. It was quite dark before we left;
the sky was continually lit up by the star
shells, very pretty white rockets, which light
up No Man's Land. The enemy has a very

As we came into Ypres, a military policeman

hit from the back, collapsed across the
street in front of my machine. Without
any ceremony I turned my machine back
along the street which we had come and
went through the Market Square down the

my section. About four hundred yards down
I stopped; holding my solo motor cycle between
my legs, standing up, I looked back.
I counted my machines as they came up. If
it hadn't been so scary, it really would
have been funny, to see these machines

coming down the road through shell holes
and over piles of bricks, as fast as the
drivers could make them go. The men were
hanging on for dear life and the machines
rocked from side to side, but they were all
there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Down the road we went to the houses;
there we parked the machines and unpacked.
A guard was placed over them and the rest

Sometimes you see a man smashed about
in a terrible way, such a mess that you think
he is a goner; he may recover. Another man
may have just a small wound and will die.
A bullet hitting a man in the head will smash

mostly self-planted, grows right up to the

A trip to No Man's Land is an excursion
which you never forget. It varies in width
and horrors. My impression was similar to
what I should feel being on Broadway without
any clothes—a naked feeling. Forty-seven
and one half inches of earth are necessary
to stop a bullet, and it's nice to have that
amount of dirt between you and the enemy's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bullets. The dead lie out in between the lines
or hang up on the wire; they don't look
pretty after they have been out some time.
It's a pleasant job to have to get their identification
disks, and we have to search the
bodies of the enemy dead for papers and
even buttons so that we can know what unit
is in front of us. Flowers grow in between,
butterflies play together, and birds nest
in the wire. When the grass becomes too
high it has to be cut, because otherwise it
would prevent good observation. In some
places grass doesn't have a chance to even
take root, let alone grow. The shells take
care of that.

once a place of beauty which people came

On May 10, we were told to prepare for the
journey to the front. Each man received his
service ammunition and two days' rations, and
we then started with heavy packs on our backs
and our water-bottles full of coffee. After a long
march we reached our reserve position, where we
were put into rest billets for two days in wooden
huts hidden in a wood. We could hear from here
the noise of the shells coming through the air.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On May 13, we moved into the trenches, in the
night. We were a whole hour moving along a
communication trench one and one-half metres
deep, right up to the front line some fifty metres
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the enemy. This was to be our post. We
had hardly got in before the bullets came flying
over our heads. Look out for the English! They
know how to shoot! I need hardly say we did
not wait to return the compliment. We answered
each one of their greetings and always with success,
inasmuch as we stood to our loopholes for
twenty-four hours with two-hour reliefs.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At length early on the 15th, at four o'clock,
came our first attack. After a preliminary smoking-out
with gas, our artillery got to work, and
about ten o'clock we climbed out of the trenches
and advanced fifty metres in the hail of bullets.
Here I got my first shot through the coat. Three
comrades were killed at the outset of the assault,
and some twenty slightly or severely wounded,
but we had obtained our object. The trench was
ours, although the English twice attempted to
turn us out of it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fight went on till eleven o'clock that evening.
We were then relieved by the 10th Company,
and made our way back along the communication
trenches to our old positions. Here
we remained until the third day, standing by at
night and passing two days without sleep. We
were hardly able to get our meals. From every
side firing was going on, and shots came plugging
two metres deep into the ground. This was my
baptism of fire. It cannot be described as it
really is—something like an earthquake, when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the big shells come at one and make holes in the
ground large enough to hold forty or fifty men
comfortably. How easy and comfortable seemed
our road back to the huts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We remained in the huts for three days, resting
before we went up again to <span class="tei tei-q">“Hell Fire,”</span> as
they call the first line trenches in front of Ypres.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then suddenly in the middle of the night an
alarm. Our neighbors had allowed themselves
to be driven out of our hard-won position, and
the 6th Company, with the 8th and 5th, had to
make good the lost ground. A hasty march
through the communication trenches up to the
front, the night lit up far and wide with searchlights
and flares and ourselves in a long chain
lying on our bellies. Towards two in the morning
the Englishmen came on, 1500 men strong.
The battle may be imagined. About 200 returned
to the line they started from. Over 1300 dead
and wounded lay on the ground. Six machine
guns and a quantity of rifles and equipment were
taken back by us, the 132d Regiment, and the
old position was once more in our possession.
What our neighbors lost the 132d regained.
There was free beer that evening and a concert!
At 11 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">p.m.</span></span> once more we withdrew to the rear,
our 2d, 4th and 10th Companies relieving us.
We slept a whole day and night like the dead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On June 15th, we again went back to rest billets,
but towards midday we were once more sent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
up to the front line to reinforce our right wing,
which was attacked by French and English.
Just as we got to our trenches we were greeted
by a heavy shell fire, the shells falling in front of
our parapets, making the sandbags totter. Seeing
this, I sprang to the spot and held the whole
thing together till the others hurried up to my
assistance. Just as I was about to let go, I must
have got my head too high above the parapet, as
I got shot in the scalp. In the excitement I did
not at once realize that I was wounded, until
Gubbert said—<span class="tei tei-q">“Hullo, Musch! Why, you're
bleeding!”</span> The stretcher-bearer tied me up,
and I had to go back to the dressing-station to
be examined. Happily it was nothing more than
a mere scalp wound, and I was only obliged to
remain on the sick-list four days, having the place
attended to.

and twenty-three wounded and the fire unceasing.
It is enough to drive one mad, and we have
to spend three days and three nights more. It
is worse than an earthquake, and any one who has
not experienced it can have no idea what it is
like. The English fired a mine, a hole fifteen
metres deep and fifty to sixty broad, and this
<span class="tei tei-q">“cauldron”</span> has to be occupied at night. At
present it isn't too badly shelled. At every shot
the dug-outs sway to and fro like a weather-cock.

From about eleven yesterday fires as if

We find the 126th have no communication with
the rear, as the communication trenches have
been completely blown in. The smoke and thirst
are enough to drive one mad. Our cooker doesn't

from the little they have. If only it would stop!
We get direct hits one after another and lie in a

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
man's teeth in the army. Now I know. It's
on account of these biscuits. The chief ingredient
is, I think, cement, and they taste
that way too. To break them it is necessary
to use the handle of your entrenching tool
or a stone. We have fried, baked, mashed,
boiled, toasted, roasted, poached, hashed,
devilled them alone and together with bully
beef, and we have still to find a way of making
them into interesting food.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
However, the Boche likes our beef. He
prefers the brand canned in Chicago to his
own, and will almost sit up and beg if we
throw some over to him. The method is as follows:
Throw one over ... sounds of shuffling
and getting out of the way are heard in the
enemy trench. Fritz thinks it's going to go
off. Pause, and throw another. Fritz not
so suspicious this time. Keep on throwing
until happy voices from enemy trenches
shout, <span class="tei tei-q">“More! Give us more!”</span> Then lob
over as many hand grenades as you can pile
into that part of the trench and tell them to
share those too.

It takes some time to distinguish whether
shells are arrivals or departures, but after a
while you get into the way of telling their
direction and size by sound. Roads are
constantly shelled, searching for troops or
supply columns. I was coming home to-day,
up a road which ran approximately at right
angles to main fire trenches. At one place
the road was exposed for a matter of thirty or
forty feet, and again farther up it was necessary
to go over the brow of a small hill. This
was about three hundred yards farther on
and was exposed to the enemy's view. Thinking
they wouldn't bother about a single
rider on a motor cycle, I went up past the
first exposed position. My carburetor was
giving me some trouble and I thought I
would see if any rain had got into it, so I
turned off the road down a cross-road and
dismounted when <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">crash</span></em>! a shell landed right
in the middle of the road as far up the exposed
place as I was round the corner. Then five
more followed the first shell. Had I gone
on I could not possibly have missed collecting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
most of the fragments. The German gunners
had spotted me in the first position and decided
that a lone man on a motor cycle must
be either an officer or despatch rider. So
they tried to get him. The shells were shrapnel
and the time was calculated splendidly.
They had taken into consideration the speed
of my motor cycle. Cross-roads are particularly
attended to, for there is a double chance
of hitting something, and in consequence it
is always unhealthy to linger on a crossroad.

To-day I was able to see what a German
seventeen-inch shell could do; one had made
a crater fifty feet across and twenty feet

the road was paved—think it over—and

I have been given a special job by the

I have my section now in the second-line
trenches waiting till it is dark before making
a move. We have to make a machine-gun

decidedly unhealthy to visit during daylight.

Arrived home about two o'clock this
morning. We crawled to the place we have
to take up, and I put some men filling sandbags
in the ruins and others even digging a
dugout. The enemy had <span class="tei tei-q">“the wind up”</span> and
were using a great number of star shells.
When one goes up we all <span class="tei tei-q">“freeze,”</span> remain motionless,
or lie still. They send them up to see
across their front, and if they locate a working

party, then they start playing a tune
with their machine guns. Bullets and shells
whistled through the trees all the time. They
seemed to come from all directions. The men
didn't like it at all. I wasn't altogether
comfortable myself, but an officer must
keep going. I walked about and joked and
laughed with them. The range-taker said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Some of us are getting the didley-i-dums,

a feeling that I had them too.

Of course, to start with, everybody thinks
every single shell and bullet is coming
straight for him. Then you find out how
much space there is around you. One man
came to tell me that two men were firing at
him with his own rifle from the ruins of the
alleged farmhouse, ten yards away from the
dugout we are making. Just then a field
mouse squeaked, and he jumped up in the
air and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“There's another.”</span> I told
the men to fill sandbags from the ruins;
they all crowded behind this three-foot-six
wall for protection; they dug up a French
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

afterwards dug up a rifle and I noticed a
suspicious smell, so I moved them.

this morning on my machine while reconnoitering
the roads—they all missed, but
they're not nice. I'm filthy, alive, and covered

It is very strange the lightness with which

Two days later I went up with the
Machine-Gun Officer of the Second Gordons
to look at a piece of ground. To get
there we had to crawl on our hands and
knees. In one part of our journey we came
to a sunken road. The day was fine, so
we lay there. He asked me about Canada.
He wanted to know something about the
settler's grant. He said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Of course you
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
know after a chap has been out here in the
open, it will be impossible to go back again
to office life.”</span> I boosted Canada and suddenly
the irony of the situation occurred to
me. Here we were lying down in a road
quite close to the German lines, so close that
it would be suicide to even stand up, and
yet here we were calmly discussing the merits
of Canadian emigration. I commented on
this and he replied: <span class="tei tei-q">“My dear fellow, when
you have been out as long as I have, you
will come to realize that being at the front
is a period of intense boredom punctuated
by periods of intense fear, and that if you
allow yourself to be carried away by depression
it will be your finish.”</span> He had been out
since just after Mons.

I was sitting one afternoon by the side of
the canal bank about two hundred yards
in front of my chateau having tea with the
officers of the East Yorks when suddenly
the chateau-smashing started again. To go
back was dangerous and useless. My men
were under cover, resting, so that they

We started to run. On the way up I
looked into the cellars to see the men whom
I, the minute previously, had mourned for,

their shirts, and the rest breaking the army
orders by <span class="tei tei-q">“shooting craps.”</span> From Bedford
House a long trail of smoke was rising and
the explosions became louder. We suddenly
discovered the <span class="tei tei-q">“Archie”</span> in flames. It was
in the courtyard and for camouflage had
been covered with branches. It was mounted
on an armored Pierce-Arrow truck. The
<span class="tei tei-q">“crump”</span> had hit it, and gasoline, paint,
branches, and hubs were supplying the fuel
which was cooking out the ammunition, the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">crack</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">crack</span></em>, being the report of single shells,
whereas one loud <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">boom</span></em> signified the explosion
of an entire box. These shells were going off
in all directions and it became dangerous to
stay too near.

It is surprising the amount of inflammable
material there is on a car. The late owner
of the car, a lieutenant in the Royal Marine
Artillery, was cursing in a low, but emphatic,
marine manner, and several other officers
from nearby batteries were attracted by the
noise and the pyrotechnic display. I spoke
to the lieutenant and sympathized with him,
and he retorted: <span class="tei tei-q">“Gott strafe Germany.
Why they should hit the <span class="tei tei-q">‘bus’</span> when I have
a brand-new pair of trench boots that I had
never worn, I dunno.”</span> Just then and there
the case cooked out and a piece of shell cut
between us and buried itself deep in the support
of a dugout, so we got under cover.

In the group was a splendid type of army
chaplain. He came over almost at the start
of the war and had seen a great deal of the
open warfare at the commencement of
hostilities. He said: <span class="tei tei-q">“My friend Fritz is
not through; he'll try to do some more yet.”</span>
As the smoke died down and the cracking
stopped, the enemy decided that an attempt
would be made either to carry out salvage
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of whatever they had hit or else we would
try to get the wounded away. So without
any preliminary warning the whole area was
covered by a battery fire of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">whiz bangs</span></span>,
and the shrapnel bullets came down like
rain, several men being hit. The fire eventually
died down and the wreck was allowed
to cool off. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Archies”</span> are used so
much to keep the aeroplanes up, and next
to the loss of his boots the officer in charge

keep the planes away, because at this time

of artillery in the neighborhood.

down, and as he looked at the red-hot armor

dugout and gave him areas for the distribution
of the four anti-aircraft guns and cars

the commander replied: <span class="tei tei-q">“Very good, sir, that
will be done with all the guns except the
third gun.”</span> The voice over the wire became
very dignified, a preliminary to becoming
sulphuric. <span class="tei tei-q">“What do you mean, all but
the third gun?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Because, sir, the enemy

Speaking of canned music reminds me we

Anything is used for trench work; often
if we waited for the proper materials we
should be uncomfortable, so it is one of
the qualifications of a good soldier to find
things. Sometimes we steal material belonging
to other units, then stick around
until the owners come back and help them
look for them; however, it is always advisable
to steal materials from juniors in
rank; if they find it out, and are senior,
then you are in for a one-sided strafe.

One of the other battery subalterns found
a deserted carpenter's shop and he let his
men loose to dismantle it. They took the
parts of steel machines and used them for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the construction of a dugout. One man
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“It's like coming home drunk and
smashing up the grand piano with an axe.”</span>
They must have attracted the attention of
the ever-alert Boche, for no sooner had they
moved out than the place was shelled to
the ground. Everything I now look at
with an eye to its value for trench construction;
thus, telegraph poles, doors, iron
girders, and rails are more valuable to us
out here than a Rolls Royce.

Slang or trench language is used universally.
My own general talks about <span class="tei tei-q">“Wipers,”</span>
the Tommy's pronunciation of Ypres, and
I have seen a reference to <span class="tei tei-q">“Granny”</span> (the
fifteen-inch howitzer) in orders <span class="tei tei-q">“mother”</span> is
the name given to the twelve-inch howitzer.
The trench language is changing so quickly
that I think the staff in the rear are unable
to keep up to date, because they have recently
issued an order to the effect that
slang must not be used in official correspondence.
Now instead of reporting that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a <span class="tei tei-q">“dud Minnie”</span> arrived over back of <span class="tei tei-q">“mud
lane,”</span> it is necessary to put, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have the
honor to report that a projectile from a
German Minnenwerfer landed in rear of
Trench F 26 and failed to explode.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sometimes names of shells go through
several changes. For example, high explosives
in the early part of the war were called <span class="tei tei-q">“black
Marias,”</span> that being the slang name for the
English police patrol wagon. Then they
were called <span class="tei tei-q">“Jack Johnsons,”</span> then <span class="tei tei-q">“coal
boxes,”</span> and finally they were christened
<span class="tei tei-q">“crumps”</span> on account of the sound they
make, a sort of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cru-ump!</span></span> noise as they
explode. <span class="tei tei-q">“Rum jar”</span> is the trench mortar.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Sausage”</span> is the slow-going aerial torpedo,
a beastly thing about six feet long with fins
like a torpedo. It has two hundred and ten
pounds of high explosive and makes a terrible
hole. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whiz bang”</span> is shrapnel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shelling is continuous. We have thousands
of pieces of shells and fuse caps about the
premises. I have in front of me a fragment
of a shell about fourteen inches long and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
about four and one-half inches across, which
came from a German gun. The edges are
so sharp that it cuts your hand to hold it.
I use it as a paper-weight.

This morning I experienced a wonderful
surprise. I had gone up to one of the North
Stafford Batteries to borrow a clinometer.
The major, while he was getting the instrument
for me, casually remarked: <span class="tei tei-q">“There's
yesterday's <span class="tei tei-q">‘Times’</span> on the bench if you care
to look at it.”</span> I turned first to the casualty
list and later to the <span class="tei tei-q">“London Gazette”</span> for
the promotions, and wholly by accident
perused carefully the Motor Machine Gun
Service list and there noted the announcement,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Keene, Louis, 2d Lieut., to be 1st
Lieut.,”</span> and for a fact this was the <span class="tei tei-q">“official”</span>
intimation that I had been promoted. I had
a couple of spare <span class="tei tei-q">“pips”</span>, rank stars, in my
pocket-book, so I got my corporal to sew
them on right away.

idea how long we are to remain up. Getting
used to the shell fire, and can sleep through
it if it's not too close. When it comes near
it makes you very thoughtful. Still working
at night and resting during the day. Made
another emplacement for one of my machine

surprising how fast men dig when the bullets

It's about 2 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.m.</span></span> We have just come in.
My new emplacement is splendid; we've
made it shell-proof and have it ready for
firing. I was coming home this afternoon
after having been to the fire trenches when
I heard a shout: <span class="tei tei-q">“Keene!”</span> I looked up on
the canal bank and I saw the general with
one of his A.D.C.'s sitting watching an
aeroplane duel. <span class="tei tei-q">“I've come up to see your
gun position, Keene.”</span> I saluted, waited
for him, and took him to it. It is below the
level of the ground under tons of bricks in
the ruins of a farmhouse. He was standing
on the roof of it and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, where's the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
emplacement?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“You're standing on it, sir.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Tut, tut, 'pon my word, that's good.”</span> He
was delighted and congratulated me on it.
My preliminary work under the eyes of the
general has gone off quite well. I start
firing to-night.

Intimacy between generals and lieutenants
is unusual, but it looks as if mine had taken
an interest in me, because when he noticed
my insect-bitten face, he sent me down some
dope he had used with good effect in India.
I expect the mosquitoes in India were the
ordinary kind, but, believe me, trench
<span class="tei tei-q">“skeeters”</span> are constructed differently and
are proof against the general's pet concoction.

I have several miners in my section who

The canal has one big lock suitable for
swimming; a lot of <span class="tei tei-q">“jocks”</span> were bathing
there to-day. I ordered a bathing parade
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

A Belgian battery commander has just
wakened up and his shells are rattling overhead.
From the fire trenches an incessant
rattle of rifles is heard; all the bullets seem
to come over here; constantly the whine of
a musical ricochet bullet is heard. Otherwise
things are dead quiet. It's getting on
for three, so I'm going to bed in my blankets
on one of the late chateau owner's splendid
spring mattresses and carved oak bedstead.
Oh! how nice it would be to sleep without
lice. From an adjoining cellar my section
are snoring, and I'm going to add to the

We have been having Sunday <span class="tei tei-q">“hate.”</span>
Eight-inch crumps are once more busting
<span class="tei tei-q">“up”</span> the chateau. How they must detest
this place. My tea and bully beef are
covered with dust of the last shell. You
have no idea how terrible the shell-fire is.

First you hear the whistle and then a terrific
burst which shakes the ground for a
hundred yards around; when it clears away
you find a hole ten feet across and six feet
deep. At least fifteen have dropped around
us in the last half hour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This place isn't somewhere in France, it's
somewhere in Hell! It has been the scene
of a great many encounters; decayed French
uniforms, old rifles, ammunition and leather
equipment and bundles of mildewed tobacco
leaves are strewn all over the place. I
found the chin-strap of a German <span class="tei tei-q">“Pickelhaube”</span>
in the grounds, the helmet of a
French cuirassier, and the red pants of a
Zouave, close together. When digging in the
trenches or anywhere near the firing line
you have to be careful: corpses, dead horses,
and cattle are buried everywhere. I'm
building a trench to my emplacement and
we have a stinking cow in the direct line;
this will have to be buried before we can cut
through.

Yesterday some of my men went swimming
in the moat of the chateau; a shell
dropped in the water near them, and threw
up a lot of fish on to the bank. That kind
of discouraged the Tommies swimming, so
they cooked the fish and decided that safety
comes before cleanliness out here.

It's hot and sticky, and when you have

All through the night we fired single shots
from a machine gun; my orders were to fire
between half-past eight at night and four
o'clock in the morning. We have a number
of guns doing this. It harasses the enemy
and keeps them from sleeping; anything
that will wear a man down is practiced
here.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I've constructed a fire emplacement
amongst the ruins underground; to get to
it you have to travel through a tunnel
eighteen feet long; inside it's very damp. I
was working with my corporal, crouched up;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we were both wet and cold, and so to cheer
things up every now and again we let off a
few rounds and warmed our hands on the
barrel. Outside it poured with rain, and
mosquitoes sought refuge inside and mealed
off me. The corporal was immune. I had
a water bottle full of whiskey and water.
We used it to keep out the cold, but it wasn't
strong enough. In a case like that you need
wood alcohol. I would like to have had some
Prohibitionists with me here. We had no
light except the flash of the gun and the
enemy star shells.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At daybreak I came home dead beat. I
got into my cellar, was so tired that I threw
myself down on the bed and wrapped myself
up in my blankets, boots, mud, lice and all.
I hadn't been asleep long before the Huns
started <span class="tei tei-q">“hating”</span> the chateau. They have
put over twenty-five large calibre shells into
my place, the grounds and the house. They
are still at it. Every time a shell bursts it
makes a hole big enough to bury five horses,
and it shakes the foundations all round. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shells are bigger than usual. The smoke
and earth are blown up fifty or sixty feet
in the air. The effect is a moral disruption.

I have divided my section up into two
teams, one in the cellars and one in the gun-pits.
I relieve them every twenty-four
hours, and I practically have to be in both
places at once, but I have got a telephone in
between the two places. I have it by my bed
so that I can constantly know how things are
going. However, the wire is cut two or three
times a day by bullets and shell splinters, my
linesman has a constant job.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fired all night; came back at six o'clock
this morning, very tired. Had a telegram
from the general to fire two thousand
rounds in twenty-four hours; this is quite
hard work. Actually we could fire the lot
in five minutes, but it would attract too
much attention. The enemy use whole batteries
of artillery to blot out machine guns
which attract attention, so we have to fire
single shots.

We have for neighbors four dead cows and
an unexploded six-inch shell, liable to go off
any time, all in a radius of one hundred yards.
We have smashed holes through five walls
so that we can go through the ruins unobserved.
In one place we pass over a dead
cow, and in another we wade through several
tons of rotten potatoes, and I believe we
have a corpse handy; and part of our
trench goes through another heap of rotten
mangles. I'm an authority on smells. I
can almost tell the nationality of a corpse now
by the smell. It will soon be necessary to
wear our smoke-helmets to go into the emplacement.
I don't think that I have told
you that I cross the Yser canal about six
times a day. I'd been up a week before I
knew what it was. Now it only has a few feet
of water in it, the rest being held in the German
locks. The part I cross over is full of
bulrushes, and is the home of moor-hens,
water rats, mosquitoes and frogs.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On one side of the canal is a bank which is
in great demand by the machine gunners, who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are able to get a certain amount of height
and observation of their fire. The general
has ordered a field gun to take up a position
on this bank. He refers to it as his <span class="tei tei-q">“Sniping
eighteen-pounder.”</span> It is firing at seven
hundred yards right at the German line and
smashes up their parapet in a style that is
pretty to watch. The machine gunners are
in a great state, because the enemy will soon
be <span class="tei tei-q">“searching”</span> with his artillery for the
eighteen-pounder and the lairs of the smaller
hidden guns will suffer.

The men are hunting for lice in their underwear.
This is the kind of conversation that
is coming through from the next cellars:

<span class="tei tei-q">“Wait a minute”</span>—a sound of tearing cloth—<span class="tei tei-q">“but
look at this lot, mother and young.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“With my forty and these you'll have to find
some more.”</span> They were betting on the
number they could find. I peel off my shirt
myself and burn them off with a candle. I
glory in the little pop they make when the
heat gets to them. All the insect powder
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

All sentries here are doubled; one thing it's
safer, and another it's company; even when
things are quiet, rats and mice scamper about
and it sets your nerves on end. Things which
are inanimate during the day become alive
at night. Trees seem to walk about. I
wonder what it tastes like to have a real
meal in which tinned food does not figure;
fancy a tablecloth; my tablecloth is a double
sheet of newspaper, and even then I can't

A German aeroplane has been hovering
over our positions looking for my gun, so
we have stopped firing and all movement.
I know just how the chicken feels when the
hawk hovers over it. Few people realize
how much aeroplanes figure in this war,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for war would be much different without
them. They do the work of Cavalry only
in the sky. Whenever they come over,
the sentries blow three blasts on their
whistles and everybody runs for cover or
freezes; guns stop firing and are covered
up with branches made on frames. If men
are caught in the open they stand perfectly
still and do not look up, for on the aeroplane
photographs faces at certain heights show
light; dugouts are covered over with trees,
straw or grass. We use aeroplane photographs
a great deal; they show trenches
distinctly and look very like the canals on
Mars.

I went over another farm to-day. It is
one of the well-ventilated kind, punched
full of holes. In the kitchen, stables and
outhouses there was a most wonderful collection
of junk: ammunition, British and
French bandoliers, old sheepskin coats abandoned
by the British troops from last winter,
smashed rifles, bayonets, meat tins, parts of
broken equipment, sandbags, stacks of rotten
potatoes and three dead cows. The fruit
trees are laden with fruit, and vines are growing
up the houses with their bunches of green
grapes.

In the garden several lonely graves are
piled high with old boots, straw, American
agricultural implements, rotting sacks and
rubbish of every description, pieces of shells,
barrels, and in one room the rusty remains
of a perambulator and sewing machine; rats
are the only inhabitants now. In the garret
(the staircase leading up to it gone long ago)
I found a British rifle, bayonet fixed, ten
rounds in the magazine, and the bolt partly
drawn out. Evidently the owner was in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
act of reloading his chamber when something
happened. The graves were dated second
and third months of this year. The poor
wooden crosses were made of pieces of ration
cases and the names written with an indelible
pencil. The wretchedness of this
farm, which was flourishing only a short
time ago, is very pathetic.

We have adopted an old Belgian mother
cat with her family of three kittens in the
dugout. Now we find that three more little
wild kittens are living in the bricks which
we have piled around the windows to protect
us against shells. They are all encouraged to

they will help to keep the rats down. Although
some of the rats are nearly the size
of cats.

were in an orchard. I happened to look up
and saw ripe plums! Terrified lest he should
see them and forestall me, I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let's
beat it, this is too unhealthy,”</span> so we crawled
back. Last night in the light of a big moon
such as coons always steal watermelons by,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a section officer and his cook crawled to the
plum tree. The section officer, being large,
stood underneath while the cook climbed the
tree and dropped them into a sandbag held
open by the S.O. They got about ten
pounds. They go well stewed, believe me.
The fact that bullets whistled through the
trees most of the time made them taste
better to-day. Sat the rest of the night in a
hedge firing at the Boches with a Lewis gun.
I struck for bed just as dawn broke.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To-day the guns are again <span class="tei tei-q">“hating”</span> the
chateau, and they have put sixty shells in
the neighborhood. Still, <span class="tei tei-q">“there's no cloud
without a silver lining.”</span> I've got a new
way home. Instead of going right around
the kennels, stables, and through the yards,
I go <span class="tei tei-q">“through”</span> the greenhouse direct,
thereby saving a lot of time. The Huns'
calendar is wrong. They have always shelled
me Sunday and Wednesday. To-day's
Tuesday!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We use up the window frames and doorways
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for kindling, and consequently the
doors have gone long ago. I have been
smashing up mouldings this morning with an
axe. We prefer the dry wood which is built
into the walls; it burns better and doesn't
cause smoke. As soon as smoke is seen rising,
the enemy's range-finders get busy and then
we suffer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another mine went up yesterday; nobody
seems to know where. I think it came south
from the French lines; it rocked the whole
neighborhood for miles. The ground here is
a kind of quicksand for a few feet down, and
shock is easily transmitted, the whole ground
being honeycombed with mines, old trenches,
shafts, saps made by French, Belgians, Germans
and our own people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The use for timber of any description is
manifold; every little bit is used up. Our
chief source of supply of dry wood is from
the smashed-up chateaux. Langhof, my home,
has been punished almost every day, and
after the bombardment lets up men from the
neighborhood come to collect the wood torn
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
up by the shelling. The men of the Tenth
East Yorks came up this morning and
climbed to the remains of the second story,
ripping up the floor boards. The enemy
evidently saw them, for the shelling soon
started. We have been shelled often here
before, but it was nothing compared to this.
The shells were carefully placed and came
over with disgusting regularity. The buildings
rocked and the whole neighborhood
shook. Fountains of bricks, mortar, and
dirt were spewed up into the air. Trees
were torn to shreds, a wall in front of me
was hit—and disappeared, a lead statue of
Apollo in the garden was hurled through the
air and landed fifty yards away crumpled
up against the balustrade of the moat.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We were in our cellars, and gradually the
shelling crept up towards us. Slowly a
solemn dread which soon moulded into a
sordid fear took possession of my being. In
a flash I began to devise a philosophy of
death for my chances were fading with every
crash. I took out my pocketbook, containing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
some letters from my mother and some personal
things, and put them on one of the
beams, so that, being in another part of the
building, they might perhaps be found some
day. The shelling continued and shells
dropped completely round the cellars, demolishing
nearly everything in sight. The
enemy evidently wanted to obliterate the
whole place. The smell of the smoke and
the dirt from the debris was choking, and
every minute we expected to be our last.
Suddenly it stopped. Philosophy and fear
disappeared simultaneously as I sputtered
out a choking laugh of relief. Then
Hawkins, my servant, in a scared voice
started, and the others joined in, singing
the old marching refrain of the Training
Camps:—

When a man has lived night after night in
a trench, he gradually finds it quite possible
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to snatch a good night's sleep. In other
words, it is merely a case of becoming acclimated
to rackets, smells and food. I had
always been able to sleep, but on the night
following the bombardment of the chateau I
just could not doze off. I thrashed about
continuously, and while in this restless state
harbored the notion that trouble was brewing
for me. Every one has had that feeling,
the feeling that hangs in your bones and
warns you to watch out. Well, that is how
I felt.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At last the sun rose and with it came a
beautiful morning, warm and sunny. I
walked out amongst the ruins to see the extent
of the damage caused by the shelling of
the previous day. I was waiting for the stew
which was cooking on a little fire near the
side of the cellar. The <span class="tei tei-q">“dixie”</span> was resting
on two old bayonets, and they in turn rested
on bricks at either side. Towards noon a
big shell came over and landed in the moat,
covering everything around with a coat of
evil-smelling, black mud. This shell was followed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by another, arriving in the part of the
ruins where once a cow-shed stood. I was
talking to Hawkins, my batman, when I saw
him dive across my front and fall flat on his
face. At the same time I was in the center
of an explosion, a great flame of light and
then bricks, wood and cement flew in all
directions. For a few seconds I thought I
was dead, then I picked myself up and saw
that blood was pouring down the front of my
jacket. I followed up the stream and found
that my right hand was smashed and hanging
limp. My men rushed out and I told them
it was nothing, but promptly fell in a heap.
When I came to, my hand was wrapped up
in an emergency bandage, and a stretcher
was coming down from Bedford House, an
advanced dressing-station, the next house
back. To the delight of the men who were
carrying it, I waved them away and told
them I could walk. Assisted up to the dressing-station
by one of my men, I made it. I
then made a discovery. A soldier is a man
until he's hit, then he's a case. I first had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an injection of <span class="tei tei-q">“anti-tetanus”</span> in the side,
and the fact was recorded on a label tied to
my left-hand top pocket button. The doctor
tied me up, then said: <span class="tei tei-q">“You'll soon be all
right. Will you have a bottle of English
beer or a drop of whiskey?”</span> I had the whiskey.
I needed it. All the time I was there
the wounded poured in. Seeing them I felt
ashamed to be there with only a smashed
hand. A corporal came in with both hands
blown off and fifty-six other wounds. He
had tried to save the men in his bay by throwing
back a German bomb and it had gone off
in his hands. Hawkins came up later on
with my helmet and the fuse head of the shell
which blew me up. We were all collected
together and waited in the dugouts of the
dressing station until dusk. Several shells
came close to us. I tried to write to my
mother with my left hand, so that when she
received the War Office cable she would
know I was able to write.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dusk came, then night, and finally the
Ford ambulance cars which were to take us
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
out of Hell. It was a beautiful night. Belgium
looked lovely. The merciful night had
thrown a veil over the war scars on the land
and a moon was shining. I was told to sit up
in the seat with the driver. We traveled
along one road, then the shelling became so
bad that the drivers decided to go back and
take another road which was running nearly
parallel. Back over the line the planes of
the Royal Flying Corps were bombing the
Forest of Houltholst, and the bursting of the
shrapnel from the German anti-aircraft guns
pierced the velvet of the sky like stars as we
went out of Belgium into France.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"><hr style="width: 50%" /></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Several times shells burst on the road, and
from the inside of the car came the stifled
groans of the men as the Ford hit limbs of
trees and shell-holes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our first stop was a ruined windmill, the
walls of which were nearly six feet thick.
Here the dangerous cases were taken off and
attended to. The last I saw of the corporal
was after they had cut off his coat at the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
seams and the doctors were taking a piece
of wire out of his chest. While I was waiting
a chaplain asked me if I would like a cup
of coffee or some whiskey, realising that it
would take some time to get the coffee made
I had some more whiskey.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was given two more tags, which this
time were tied on buttons at the top of my
jacket. I stayed here about two hours, then
I was sent to a clearing hospital. It was
here that I met the first nurses. They were
two fine, splendid women who were wearing
the scarlet hoods of the British Regular Army
nurse. They were both strong and quite
capable of handling a man, even if he became
delirious. One of them quickly got me into
bed. I apologized for my terribly dirty state,
but I was told that it made no difference;
they were used to it. To be between clean
sheets again was wonderful. I felt I wanted
to go to sleep forever. Suddenly a roar, and
a terrible explosion. The hospital was being
bombed; a bomb had dropped within a
hundred yards of my tent. This was the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
German reprisal for our bombing Houltholst.
They deliberately bombed a hospital. The
doctor at this hospital next day looked
at my hand and said in a nonchalant way,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Looks as though you will lose it.”</span> At that
time it didn't strike me as a great loss to lose
a hand, even if it was my <span class="tei tei-q">“painting hand.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The hospital train of the next day was
crowded and the nurse in charge of my coach
was named Keene. We tried in the little
spare time she had to see if we couldn't work
out our genealogy and find out if we were
even remotely connected, but before we did
we came to the station of Étaples and then
went to the Duchess of Westminster Hospital
at Latouquet. Here I was operated on.
A piece of Krupp's steel was taken out of
my hand and a rubber drainage tube inserted
instead. The Duchess used to come round
a great deal and won everybody's affection.
She used to sit on my bed and talk to me
about pleasant things. So unlike many
people who visit hospitals and ask the
patients silly war questions, such as: <span class="tei tei-q">“How
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
does it feel to be wounded?”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Which
hurts more, a bayonet or a shell wound?”</span>
One exasperated Tommy, when asked if the
shell hit him, said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Naw, it crept up behind
and bit me.”</span>

            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
            visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class="tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
            have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and
            addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
